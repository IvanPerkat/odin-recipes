    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pljukanci is a type of pasta typical of the Istria region of Croatia . They are made with flour , water , eggs and salt .</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g smooth flour</li>
        <li>2 pinches of salt</li>
        <li>150 ml of boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate 2 spoons from the flour, which will be used to finish the dough.
            Mix salt into the remaining flour, make a well and pour boiling water. As the water is boiling, first mix the dough with a wooden spoon, then with your hands.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle those 2 tablespoons of flour on the work surface and shake out the dough. Knead the dough by kneading it with your wrist until it becomes smooth and does not stick to the surface. If necessary, add a little more flour. The dough should be hard otherwise it will fall apart during cooking.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rest for about 15 minutes. Then divide into 4 parts. Roll each with your hands into a long, finger-thick roll, on a dry surface . The dough will not stick. If it sticks, flour the surface. Cut with a knife into pieces the size of hazelnuts.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece of dough up and down the surface with your fingers, then spread your fingers and roll the ends 2-3 times. The rolled dough is thicker in the middle and narrows towards the ends.</li>
        <li>Freezing: Spread the floured spits on a flat surface with paper, cover with transparent film and freeze. Transfer the frozen ones to a bag and store in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Cook without first defrosting.</li>
    </ol>
